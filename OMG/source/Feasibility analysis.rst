Feasibility analysis 

=======================



Constraints

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The system should consider some constraints (such as spatial complexity, version compatibility, etc.) and solve them when it encounters problems. 



System Development Environment  

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  It is very important to choose a good programming language. Nowadays, facing many programming languages, many people have no choice. We choose Java language in this system. The reason for choosing the Java language is that it can easily separate the interface display from the business logic with its powerful object-oriented function. 





Technical Feasibility Analysis 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          

   The technical feasibility analysis mainly includes four aspects: whether the current technology can support the new system developed; the number and level of new system developers, namely human resources; hardware and software resources.
