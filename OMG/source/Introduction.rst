Introduction

===============

This is a Java-based system for analyzing the differences between gene expressions 



 1.1.purpose

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

According to the genes of the two cell samples input, the related charts can be formed to help the people who need to analyze the samples more easily and easily. 



1.2.Overview

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A simple UI interface is designed to read the gene text document input by the user. According to the gene text, scatter plots are generated randomly. At the same time, coordinates are output from the console.a scatter plot of these genes whose X-axis is ControlSample and Y-axis is KnockOutSample. 



1.3.User Characteristics

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Biologists or biologists who need to analyze a large number of comparisons between the two groups of genes.



1.4.Network Application of JAVA Language 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Java programs can acquire images, sounds, HTML documents and text of nodes on the network, and process the acquired resources. For example, Java programs can read the latest data provided by a node at regular intervals and display it in a chart. In programming, the general gentleman forms an object of URL type, and then obtains the resources represented by the object by the corresponding method in Java. Java Applet can get the image directly from the nodes on the network and display it. 



 1.5.Terminologies & Abbreviations Explaination

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



Terminology 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

*   *Cells in the experimental group*: Cells cultured under experimental or abnormal conditions.           

*   *Control group cells*: cells cultured under normal conditions            

*   *Differentially expressed genes*: genes with significantly different expression levels between the two samples.           

*   *Upregulation*: If a gene is expressed higher in therapy than in the control group, then the gene is up-regulated. 



 abbreviation           

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

  Logfc-logarithmic variation of gene expression. Log 2 [t/c], where t is the gene expression level of the treatment sample, and C is the gene expression level of the control sample.
